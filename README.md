### Seminar Paper for University (Design of user interfaces)

### This project is a seminar paper for the course Design of user interfaces. Although in today's curriculum it is quite common to use outdated technologies and approaches. (in this case we are talking about the Department of Computer Technology) And if you do not talk about it will not change. So here, how can be the final project for the subject of Design of user interfaces made in a file index.html when of course in any project on the production you will not see such a thing. No modern framework or library is used. For example bootstrap is used for styling, although other than tailwindcss and material ui or their own styling libraries, although that's okay. For example let's talk about how the React library could improve this project.

#### Inline styles: The code extensively uses inline styles (e.g., style attributes within HTML tags) to define the presentation of elements. Inline styles can make the code harder to maintain and update. Separating the styles into a separate CSS file allows for easier management and reusability.

#### Lack of component-based structure: The code lacks a modular structure and uses traditional HTML markup. Modern front-end frameworks like React provide a component-based architecture, which makes it easier to manage and reuse code. React components encapsulate their own logic, styles, and markup, leading to improved code organization and maintainability.

#### Limited interactivity: The code relies on jQuery for interactivity, such as handling click events and showing/hiding elements. While jQuery is a popular library, modern frameworks like React provide a more declarative and efficient way of handling interactions through their component-based approach.

#### By using modern technologies such as React, the code could be simplified and improved in the following ways:

#### Component-based architecture: The code could be rewritten using React components, which would allow for better code organization and reusability. Each section of the page (e.g., navbar, info section, member section) could be created as a separate component with its own logic, styles, and markup.

#### Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM allows for efficient updates and rendering of components. Instead of manually manipulating the DOM with jQuery, React would handle the updates and re-render only the necessary components when the state or props change.

#### Improved state management: React provides a state management system that simplifies the handling of data and state changes within components. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

#### CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS: Instead of using inline styles or a separate CSS file, React allows for the use of CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS libraries, which provide scoped styles that are encapsulated within each component. This approach avoids potential CSS conflicts and makes styles more maintainable.

#### Enhanced interactivity: React provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for handling interactivity, such as React Router for managing navigation, Redux for state management in complex applications, and React animations libraries for smooth transitions and animations.

#### Overall, using modern technologies like React would simplify the code, improve maintainability, and provide a more efficient and interactive user experience.
